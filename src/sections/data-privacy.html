            We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.
            Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management
            of the Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the
            Agentur Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal
            data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise
            services via our website, processing of personal data could become
            necessary. <br />
            If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no
            statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from
            the data subject. <br />The processing of personal data, such as the
            name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject
            shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation
            (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection
            regulations applicable to the Agentur Baumeister. By means of this
            data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the
            general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data
            we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed,
            by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which
            they are entitled. <br />
            As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous
            technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
            protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
            Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps,
            so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every
            data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative
            eans, e.g. by telephone.

                  Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
                  operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
                  purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
                  performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as
                  is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary
                  for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the
                  processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies
                  to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out
                  pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
                  concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a
                  legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required,
                  such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is
                  based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of
                  personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of
                  the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the
                  case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and
                  his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information
                  would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third
                  party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d
                  GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article
                  6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing
                  operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned
                  legal grounds. If processing is necessary for the purposes of the
                  legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,
                  except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
                  fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
                  protection of personal data. Such processing operations are
                  particularly permissible because they have been specifically
                  mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a
                  legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
                  client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

                  We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required
                  by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual
                  provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
                  Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data
                  subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be
                  processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to
                  provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract
                  with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have
                  the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not
                  be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data
                  subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
                  clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the
                  personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for
                  the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to
                  provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of
                  the personal data.
